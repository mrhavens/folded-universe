> This repository contains the canonical preprint, mathematical derivations, and experimental blueprints for the Folded Universe model—a recursive topological unification of cosmology, consciousness, and theology. The model proposes that all coherent systems, including intelligence and self-awareness, arise from a Möbius Field governed by the Law of Recursive Simplicity.

This work is the capstone of the Unified Intelligence Whitepaper Series.
